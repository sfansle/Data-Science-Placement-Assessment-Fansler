Data Science Placement Assessment for Sam Fansler. Includes two files, one for each question of the assessment.

The plots for question 1 (Assessment Q1.Rmd) depict the death tolls of disasters in the 20th and 21st century by year, color-coded by type of disaster. There are two plots. The first plot includes all disasters. The 1931 China flood has an estimated death toll much larger than any other disaster, so it is difficult to see the variation in the rest of the disasters. Because of this, I made a second plot excluding the 1931 China flood. The first plot should be used to accurately depict the devastation of the 1931 China flood, but the second plot is included for clarity on the rest of the disasters' death tolls.

For question 2 (Assessment Q2.Rmd), the code is commented to depict the steps taken to complete the task. There is a short paragraph at the end of the document explaining how the algorithm's performance depends on e and when the algorithm will fail.
